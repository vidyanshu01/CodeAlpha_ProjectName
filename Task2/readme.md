# CodeAlpha Task 2 — Exploratory Data Analysis on Titanic Dataset 🚢

## 📌 Overview

This project is part of my **Data Analytics Internship at CodeAlpha**.  
In this task, I performed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the famous **Titanic dataset** to uncover insights about passenger survival based on different factors like **gender**, **age**, **class**, and **family size**.

## 📂 Dataset

- Dataset Used: [Titanic Dataset - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)
- Format: CSV
- Rows: ~891 passengers
- Columns: Passenger details (Name, Age, Sex, Pclass, Survived, etc.)

## 💻 Tools & Libraries

- **Python**
- **Pandas** — data manipulation
- **NumPy** — numerical operations
- **Matplotlib** — data visualization
- **Seaborn** — statistical visualizations
- **Jupyter Notebook** — code execution and documentation

## 🔍 Key EDA Questions

1. What percentage of passengers survived?
2. Did gender influence survival rates?
3. What is the age distribution of passengers?
4. Which passenger class had the highest survival?
5. Did family presence affect survival rates?

- Survival count plots
- Gender vs Survival
- Age distribution histogram
- Class vs Survival
- Heatmap of correlations

## 📊 Key Insights

- **Females** had a much higher survival rate than males.
- **1st class** passengers had better chances of survival.
- **Children under 10** had higher survival rates.
- Passengers with small families (1–2 members) had higher survival rates.
